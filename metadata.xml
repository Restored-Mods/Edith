[h2]Restored Edith[/h2]

Edith is a soul heart character that moves via sliding along the room's grid, moving one tile at a time. 
She is only able to move in cardinal directions, but is able to perform an omni-directional jump that can be aimed with the bomb button.

The stomp deals damage and knockback to nearby enemies. Killing an enemy with a stomp grants a short moment of invincibility.
Edith's stomp recharges in 3 seconds, charging faster while standing still. Bombs can be placed normally while the stomp is not charged (Configurable).

Pressing the swap key (Control on keyboard) will toggle Edith's stomp to consume a bomb, causing an explosion upon landing. This explosion inherits all bomb effects.
